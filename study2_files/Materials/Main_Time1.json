You will also be asked to emit certain responses regarding this behavior using the keyboard. During this task, you will be asked to be as quick and accurate as possible. Please only participate if you have no problem with providing such personal information. You are expected to pay close attention throughout the experiment and to work as accurately as possible. When questions are being asked, you are expected to answer truthfully.\r\n    </p>\r\n  <p style=\"font-size: 12pt;margin-top:2px;\"><b>Risks and benefits.</b>\r\n  This study involves no more risk to your physical or psychological health beyond those encountered in the normal course of everyday life. Please note that participating in this study will not benefit your psychological health and is not an alternative to any form of psychological help.</p>\r\n   <p style=\"font-size: 12pt;margin-top:2px;\"><b> Confidentiality.</b>\r\n   Any information obtained in this study will be kept strictly confidential and used solely for research purposes. We do not ask any identifying information (other than your Prolific ID code) and responses will be kept completely anonymous. Your anonymized data (i.e., Prolific ID codes will be removed from the data) will be posted to a public repository for other researchers to make use of (e.g., to replicate the results of this experiment).</p>\r\n   <p style=\"font-size: 12pt;margin-top:2px;\"><b>Results.</b>\r\n   After this study has ended and the data have been processed, it is possible to receive a summary of the research results. \r\nIf you want to do so, please contact the researcher via the ‘Contact researcher’ button on the Prolific experiment page (please note that it might take a few weeks before a study is completely finished and the data fully processed).</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;margin-top:2px;\"><b>Your rights.</b> Your decision to participate in this research is voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to. </p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;margin-top:2px;\"><b>Payment policy.</b>\r\nIf you complete the full study, you will receive full payment for your participation.

Instructions on how you can receive this partial reward will be available throughout the study.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12pt;margin-top:2px;\"><b> Questions/issues.</b>\r\nIf you have any questions or issues with this study or regarding the questions that were asked, please use the ‘Contact researcher’ button on the Prolific experiment page (please mention the study name). The researcher will respond as quickly as possible.\r\n<br><br> People sometimes tend to have the urge to harm themselves or have thoughts about harming themselves. If this is the case for you, we encourage you to contact someone who can help you cope with these thoughts and actions and with any stressful events that may have caused them. \r\n<br>If you have questions about this or wish to contact someone who can help you, you can click on one of these links: <a href=\"https://www.suicidestop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website 1</a> or <a href=\"http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html\" target=\"_blank\">website 2</a>\r\n<br>These are websites that contain hotlines for different countries. Please note that the websites say ‘suicide’, but you can also get help with regard to (non-suicidal) self-injury. On most websites, you can contact someone through chat or by telephone. You can also make a personal face-to-face appointment. The websites also contain self-help guides. Please be safe, and consider contacting someone. \r\n<br><b>Please note that we will provide the links to these websites again at the end of the study</b></p>\r\n</body>\r\n<footer class=\"content-vertical-center content-horizontal-center\">\r\n  <h4><b> Press the <kbd> space bar </kbd> if you have read this information and if you are ready to continue </h4></b> \r\n</footer> ",
