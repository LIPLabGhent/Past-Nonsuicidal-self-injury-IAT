# Past-Nonsuicidal-self-injury-IAT
This repository contains the code for an adapted version of the autobiographical IAT, using statements about Nonsuicidal self-injury. The procedure was validated and used to predict Nonsuicidal self-injury in Catheleyn, Van Dessel &amp; De Houwer (2022).

## Task description

*Description of procedure from manuscript*: <br>
The P-NSSI-IAT followed the standard procedure of the IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998). On each trial of the P-NSSI-IAT, a statement appeared in the middle of the screen. Participants were instructed to categorize those stimuli as fast as possible by pressing the “E” or “I” keys on the keyboard. Category labels were presented in the top left and right corners to aid categorization. If the response was correct, the stimulus disappeared, and the next stimulus was presented 400ms later. If the response was incorrect, a red cross replaced the stimulus for 200ms, and the next stimulus appeared 400ms after the red cross appeared. During the first block, participants practiced categorizing statements regarding past NSSI behavior (e.g., “I have carved my skin on purpose”) and past non-NSSI behavior (e.g., “I have carved my skin not once”). During the second block, participants practiced categorizing statements that were logically true (e.g., “I’m doing a psychology experiment”) and statements that were logically false (e.g., “I’m climbing a mountain”). Both practice blocks consisted of 24 trials. Subsequently, participants completed 48 critical trials during which statements from all four categories were categorized. During these trials, statements regarding past NSSI behavior and statements that were logically true shared one response key, whereas statements regarding past non-NSSI behavior and statements that were logically false shared the other response key. Then, participants practiced sorting statements regarding past NSSI behavior and statements regarding past non-NSSI behavior with the response key assignment reversed, for 24 trials. Finally, participants completed 48 trials during which statements from all four categories were categorized using the new response key assignment.

Scores for the P-NSSI-IAT were calculated using the D4 scoring algorithm (Greenwald et al., 2003). Reaction times on trials of the first critical block were subtracted from reaction times on trials of the second critical block, such that higher scores indicated faster responding during critical blocks in which statements regarding past NSSI behavior and statements that were logically true shared the same response key (Spearman-Brown corrected split-half reliability = .73).
